# Tests

This folder contains test files to be run to validate aspects of these tutorial files.

## List of validation tests

### Internal links

From this `tests` folder, run the script `validate_internal_md_links.py`.  This file searches all markdown files for internal `[label](path/to/doc.md)` references and checks that those files exist.

From this `tests` folder, run the script `validate_internal_img_links.py`.  This file searches all markdown files for internal `![label](path/to/image.ext)` references and checks that those files exist.

From this `tests` folder, run the script `check_for_unreferenced_figs.py`. This file searches all markdown files for internal `![label](path/to/image.ext)` references, then cross-checks against a list of all figures assets to check that no unreferenced files exist.

### External links

From this `tests` folder, run the script `validate_external_links.py`.  This file searches all markdown files for external URLs and checks for a 200 status code using the `requests` library.

*That's all folks!*
