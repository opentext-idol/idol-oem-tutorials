    > NOTE: In these tutorials you will primarily use SDKs, where you will embed this license key, know that this license key can also be used to enable IDOL License Server, which can only run on the machine whose details are specified and which listens for HTTP requests from other IDOL components to provide them license seats.  That servers' default port is `20000` but you are free to change this.

    > HINT: To obtain your MAC address and host name on Windows, open a command prompt and enter `ipconfig /all`.  Now look for the "Host Name" and "Physical Address" fields:

    > ![ipconfig](./figs/ipconfig.png)
    >
    > On Linux the equivalent command is [`ifconfig`](https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8).

1. Click "Next", then confirm your details and click "Submit".  You will soon received your key, which is a `.dat` file, by email.
