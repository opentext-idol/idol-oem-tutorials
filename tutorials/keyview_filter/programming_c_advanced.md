## Using a custom stream

Until now, you have been operating exclusively on files on disk. However, there are many situations where the information is not stored in this way â€“ perhaps it is being read from a network, or output by another operation. In these cases, you might want to use the Filter SDK in stream mode.

### Defining a custom stream

You can implement a custom stream by filling out a [KVInputStream](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/KeyviewFilterSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/Content/C/filtering_structures/KVInputStream.htm) structure with functions that perform the appropriate actions. Each of these are equivalent to the ANSI counterparts (fopen, fread, and so on), except several functions return a BOOL rather than an error code.

To illustrate how to use a custom stream, the following example defines a very simple stream that forwards to the file-based operations.

```c
typedef struct
{
    const char* filename;
    FILE* fp;
    int openCount;
} StreamInfo;

BOOL pascal streamOpen(KVInputStream* stream)
{
    if(!stream || !stream->pInputStreamPrivateData)
    {
        return FALSE;
    }
    StreamInfo* info = (StreamInfo*)stream->pInputStreamPrivateData;
    
    //Open may be called more than once, and the subsequent calls should be a no-op
    if (info->fp == NULL)
    {
        info->fp = fopen(info->filename, "rb");
    }

    if (info->fp)
    {
        fseek(info->fp, 0, SEEK_SET);
        info->openCount++;
    }

    return info->fp != NULL;
}

UINT pascal streamRead(KVInputStream* stream, BYTE * buffer, UINT size)
{
    if(!stream || !stream->pInputStreamPrivateData)
    { 
        return 0;
    }
    StreamInfo* info = (StreamInfo*)stream->pInputStreamPrivateData;
    return fread(buffer, 1, size, info->fp);
}

BOOL pascal streamSeek (KVInputStream* stream, long offset, int whence)
{
    if(!stream || !stream->pInputStreamPrivateData)
    { 
        return FALSE;
    }
    StreamInfo* info = (StreamInfo*)stream->pInputStreamPrivateData;

    return fseek(info->fp, offset, whence) == 0;
}

long pascal streamTell(KVInputStream* stream)
{
    if(!stream || !stream->pInputStreamPrivateData)
    { 
        return FALSE;
    }
    StreamInfo* info = (StreamInfo*)stream->pInputStreamPrivateData;

    return ftell(info->fp);
}

BOOL pascal streamClose(KVInputStream* stream)
{
    if(!stream || !stream->pInputStreamPrivateData)
    { 
        return FALSE;
    }
    StreamInfo* info = (StreamInfo*)stream->pInputStreamPrivateData;
    int retval = 0;

    if (info->openCount > 0)
    {
        --info->openCount;
    }

    if (info->openCount == 0)
    {
        retval = fclose(info->fp);
        info->fp = NULL;
    }
    return retval == 0;
}

StreamInfo info = {pathToInputFile, NULL};
stream.pInputStreamPrivateData = &info;
stream.lcbFilesize = 0;
stream.fpOpen = streamOpen;
stream.fpRead = streamRead;
stream.fpSeek = streamSeek;
stream.fpTell = streamTell;
stream.fpClose = streamClose;
```

If you already know the size of the document when you create the stream, you can use this information to fill out the lcbFilesize member. This option can reduce the number of seeks required, because the Filter SDK does not need to seek to the end of the file to determine the size.

If you do not know the size, you **must** set this member to zero. Failure to set this member results in undefined behavior.

### Opening a document from a stream

After you define a stream, you can create a KVDocument using the stream by calling [fpOpenDocumentFromStream](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/KeyviewFilterSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/Content/C/filtering_functions/fpOpenDocumentFromStream.htm). This functions in the same way as a document created using fpOpenDocumentFromFile. You must not open a second document from a stream until the first document has been closed.

```c
KVDocument document = NULL;

error = filter.fpOpenDocumentFromStream(session, &stream, &document);

//Pass document to Filter SDK functions

filter.fpCloseDocument(document);
```

Filtering text and extracting subfiles, on the other hand, have a slightly different interface, which offers more flexibility and can improve performance.

### Extracting subfiles using streams

The Filter SDK also lets you access the subfiles as streams, rather than needing to extract them to disk. Because some Filter SDK operations do not need to read the entire file, you might get a performance benefit by avoiding the need to extract all the data from the file.

To access a subfile as a stream, use the [fpOpenSubFile()](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/KeyviewFilterSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/Content/C/extract/fpOpenSubFile.htm) function, rather than using `fpExtractSubFile()`. The [KVExtractSubFileArgRec](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/KeyviewFilterSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/Content/C/extract/KVExtractSubFileArg.htm) is the same as before.

```c
KVInputStream substream = NULL;
error = extract.fpOpenSubFile(fileContext, &extractArg, &substream);

//Use sub file stream

extract.fpCloseSubFile(substream);
```

You can use the [fpGetExtractInfo](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/KeyviewFilterSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/Content/C/extract/fpGetExtractInfo.htm) function to retrieve the KVSubFileExtractInfo structure associated with the subfile, and the [fpGetExtractStatus()](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/KeyviewFilterSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/Content/C/extract/fpGetExtractStatus.htm) function to return more information about any errors encountered when using the subfile stream.

When you parse this stream back into the Filter SDK interface, it must be on a different session to the one that started the Extract session. Because initializing a new session can incur a performance cost, we recommend that you do this once, and then reuse this session for each sub file.

## Partial filtering

For some use cases, you may not need all of the text from the file, or want to analyze the text in small pieces. The [fpFilter()](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/KeyviewFilterSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/Content/C/filtering_functions/fpFilter.htm) function outputs the text in chunks, by filling out a [KVFilterOutput](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/KeyviewFilterSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/Content/C/filtering_structures/KVFilterOutput.htm) structure. You must also free this structure using [fpFreeFilterOutput](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/KeyviewFilterSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/Content/C/filtering_functions/fpFreeFilterOutput.htm).

The end of the stream is indicated by an empty KVFilterOutput structure. You do not need to free the empty structure.

If you want to keep track of how many bytes have been output, you can accumulate the cbText field of KVFilterOutput.

```c
uint64_t totalSize = 0;

while(1)
{
    KVFilterOutput output = {0};
        
    error = filter->fpFilter(document, &output);
    
    if(error != KVError_Success)
    {
        return error;
    }
    
    if(output.cbText == 0)
    {
        break;
    }
    
    totalSize += output.cbText;

    //Use filter output

    filter->fpFreeFilterOutput(session, &output);
}
```

You might find you want to stop processing before you have filtered the entire file - for example, because you have already found a search term, or because you have hit a resource threshhold. You can safely stop processing, as long as you still call [fpFreeFilterOutput()](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/KeyviewFilterSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/Content/C/filtering_functions/fpFreeFilterOutput.htm) and [fpCloseDocument()](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/KeyviewFilterSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/Content/C/filtering_functions/fpCloseDocument.htm).

## Build & Run

### Build

1. Copy the `idol-oem-tutorials\resources\keyview_filter\sdk\C` folder to `%KEYVIEW_HOME%\samples\tutorial`.  The provided makefile(s) leverage components of the samples' makefile where relative paths are used.
2. Use the provided makefile to build. Open a `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019` cmd prommpt
   ```sh
   > cd %KEYVIEW_HOME%\samples\tutorial
   > nmake tutorial_file_win_x86_64.mak`
   ```
3. The `%KEYVIEW_HOME%\samples\tutorial` folder will have bin folder containing 

### Run

Since `tutorial.h` specified the `YOUR_BIN_DIR` for the Filter SDK, you can run the built exe from the `bin` folder as shown below:
```sh
> set PATH=C:\OpenText\KeyviewFilterSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\bin
> cd C:\OpenText\KeyviewFilterSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\tutorial\bin
> tutorial_stream ..\..\..\..\idol-oem-tutorials\resources\keyview_filter\KeyViewFilterSDK_12.13.0_ReleaseNotes_en.pdf out
```

The `out` file will have the text from the input PDF file.

For extra credit, try with your own input file(s) and/or the others provided with this tutorial.
