# Filter SDK + Named Entity Recognition SDK

This track of the OEM tutorials is focused on using the Filter SDK with Named Entity Recognition SDK.  

Below are links to lessons, which will illustrate how to use the Filter SDK to process files and then feed the extracted text to the Named Entity Recognition SDK.

## Introduction

These lessons assume that you have completed the [Filter SDK](../keyview_filter/README.md) and [Named Entity Recognition SDK](../eduction/README.md) Introduction lessons and the SDK programming related ones.

## Use the Filter SDK and Named Entity Recognition SDK

Named Entity Recognition expects UTF-8 text as its input.  The Filter SDK is a natural fit to process supported file formats, extracting text as UTF-8.

### Python API

[Get started](./programming_python.md).
