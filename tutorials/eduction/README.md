# Named Entity Recognition

This track of the Knowledge Discovery (formerly known as IDOL) OEM tutorials is focussed on Named Entity Recognition (aka Eduction).  

Below are links to lessons, which will take you through an introduction to Named Entity Recognition, exploration of advanced features, as well as ways to use Named Entity Recognition in your environment.

## Introduction

Make a solid start with Named Entity Recognition.  Use the out-of-the-box binaries to develop your understanding of the key features and capabilities for matching entities in free text.

[Get started](./introduction.md).

## Capability showcase

Do more with Named Entity Recognition.

> NOTE: This guide assumes you have already completed the introductory Named Entity Recognition lesson above.

### Use the PII Named Entity Recognition grammars

Explore and use out-of-the-box grammars to match PII entities.

[Get started](./pii_grammar.md).

### Use the PCI Named Entity Recognition grammars

Explore and use out-of-the-box grammars to match PCI entities.

[Get started](./pci_grammar.md).

### Use the PHI Named Entity Recognition grammars

Explore and use out-of-the-box grammars to match PHI entities.

[Get started](./phi_grammar.md).

### Use the Government Named Entity Recognition grammars

Explore and use out-of-the-box grammars to match Government markings entities.

[Get started](./gov_grammar.md).

### Extract Table Oriented Data

Extract entities from files with row / column oriented data.

[Get started](./table_mode.md).

### Assessing Performance of Named Entity Recognition

Measure speed of extraction.

[Get started](./assess_performance.md).

### Create a custom Named Entity Recognition grammar

Develop your own rules to match entities.

[Get started](./custom_grammar.md).

### Create a custom post processing script

Develop your own validation scripts to post-process matched entities.

[Get started](./custom_postprocessing.md).

## Use Named Entity Recognition Server

Perform Named Entity Recognition as a service by calling the Named Entity Recognition Server using the ACI API.

[Get started](./eduction_server.md).

## Use the Named Entity Recognition SDK API

Named Entity Recognition is designed to be embedded into other services via an API.

[Get started](./eduction_sdk_api.md).
