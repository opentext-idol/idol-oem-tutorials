# Named Entity Recognition SDK C API

The Named Entity Recognition SDK is designed to be embedded into other services. To facilitate embedding, the Named Entity Recognition SDK has APIs for C, Java and .NET.  In addition, the Named Entity Recognition SDK runs natively on the following platforms: Windows (x86_64, x86_32 and ARM_64), Linux (x86_64 and ARM_64) and MacOS (x86_64 and Apple M*).

In this lesson, you will:

- use the Named Entity Recognition SDK C API to perform extraction using a configuration file
- use the Named Entity Recognition SDK C API to compile a grammar XML into an ECR

The [Named Entity Recognition User and Programming Guide](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol//knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/EductionSDK/APIReference/C_APIConcepts.htm) has sections on this topic which will be referenced in this lesson.

> NOTE: This lesson only covers the Named Entity Recognition SDK APIs and does not cover Named Entity Recognition Server. See [here](./README.md#use-named-entity-recognition-server) for a lesson on Named Entity Recognition Server.

> NOTE: This guide assumes you have already completed the introductory Named Entity Recognition [tutorial](../eduction/introduction.md).

## API Documentation

API specific documentation is located in sub-folders of `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\` as noted below:

- C - `c_api\help\index.html`

## Example programs

Example programs (with resources) ship with the `EductionSDK_<VERSION>_<PLATFORM>.zip` and `EductionGrammars_<VERSION>_COMMON.zip`.  The sample programs cover topics:

- performing different types of extraction / redaction.
- compiling an XML grammar into an ECR file

### `eduction_from_config`

The `eduction_from_config` sample program accepts a configuration file as you've been using in the other Named Entity Recognition lessons, an UTF-8 text file, a path to the output JSON file and some optional arguments to override the configuration.

#### Sample `eduction_from_config` code

The C sample `eduction_from_config` application code lives in: `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\c`.

#### Build `eduction_from_config`

Open the folder `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\c` in Visual Studio.  Visual Studio may take some time interpreting and using the provided `CMakeLists.txt`.

In the "Solution Explorer" view, right-click on the modified "CMakeLists.txt" and click "Build".  You can proceed if you get `Build succeeded.`

#### Run `eduction_from_config`

Run your compiled program from the command prompt:

> NOTE: Be sure your PATH environment variable has the full path to your %EDK_HOME%\bin so that `edk.dll` can be found as shown below:

```sh
> set PATH=C:\Opentext\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\bin;%PATH%
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\c
> out\build\x64-Debug\eduction_from_config.exe "..\resources\test\config\test.cfg" "..\resources\test\input\input.txt" "..\resources\test\educed.EDK.JSON"
Program loaded.
Config Path:  ..\resources\test\config\test.cfg
Document Path: ..\resources\test\input\input.txt
Output File: ..\resources\test\educed.EDK.JSON
Parameters valid.
Successfully configured 1 post-processing tasks.
Engine created.
Session created.
Input stream set for session.
Printing results to ..\resources\test\educed.EDK.JSON...
Found 2 matches in total.
Extraction complete.
```

Review `educed.EDK.JSON` to see the match information.  The program should run and produce an output file `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\resources\test\educed.EDK.JSON` containing two matches, as follows:

```json
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "matched_text": "foo bar",
      "entity_name": "test/two_words",
      "offset": 12,
      "offset_length": 12,
      "matched_text_length": 7,
      "matched_text_size": 7,
      "normalized_text": "foo bar",
      "normalized_text_length": 7,
      "normalized_text_size": 7,
      "score": 1.00,
      "components": [
        {
          "name": "FIRST",
          "normalized_text": "foo",
          "normalized_text_length": 3,
          "normalized_text_size": 3,
          "normalized_text_offset": 0,
          "normalized_text_offset_length": 0
        },
        {
          "name": "SECOND",
          "normalized_text": "bar",
          "normalized_text_length": 3,
          "normalized_text_size": 3,
          "normalized_text_offset": 4,
          "normalized_text_offset_length": 4
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "matched_text": "baz bah",
      "entity_name": "test/two_words",
      "offset": 20,
      "offset_length": 20,
      "matched_text_length": 7,
      "matched_text_size": 7,
      "normalized_text": "baz bah",
      "normalized_text_length": 7,
      "normalized_text_size": 7,
      "score": 1.00,
      "components": [
        {
          "name": "FIRST",
          "normalized_text": "baz",
          "normalized_text_length": 3,
          "normalized_text_size": 3,
          "normalized_text_offset": 0,
          "normalized_text_offset_length": 0
        },
        {
          "name": "SECOND",
          "normalized_text": "bah",
          "normalized_text_length": 3,
          "normalized_text_size": 3,
          "normalized_text_offset": 4,
          "normalized_text_offset_length": 4
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

For extra credit, try `eduction_from_config` on other Named Entity Recognition configurations, insuring that configuration file paths are correct.

Review the `eduction_from_config` C source code to gain more insights into how to incorporate the Named Entity Recognition SDK C API into your application.

### `compile`

In some use cases for Named Entity Recognition, custom grammars either for net-new entities and/or extending the entities in the licensed grammar packs.

> NOTE: While the Named Entity Recognition SDK engine does support XML based resource files, pre-compiling them into ECRs is recommended.

The `compile` sample program accepts a grammar XML and output ECR.

#### Sample `compile` code

The C sample `compile` application code lives in: `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\compile\c`.

#### Build `compile`

Open the folder `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\compile\c` in Visual Studio.  Visual Studio may take some time interpreting and using the provided `CMakeLists.txt`.

In the "Solution Explorer" view, right-click on the modified "CMakeLists.txt" and click "Build".  You can proceed if you get `Build succeeded.`

#### Run `compile`

Run your compiled program from the command prompt:

> NOTE: Be sure your PATH environment variable has the full path to your %EDK_HOME%\bin so that `edk.dll` can be found as shown below:

```sh
> set PATH=C:\Opentext\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\bin;%PATH%
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\compile\c
> out\build\x64-Debug\compile.exe "..\resources\test\source\test.xml" "..\resources\test\test_c.ecr"
Program loaded.
INFO: Grammar Path:  ..\resources\test\source\test.xml
INFO: Output Path:   ..\resources\test\test_c.ecr
Parameters valid.
Engine created.
Grammar source file loaded and compiled.
Compiled grammar file saved.
Program completed without an error.
```

The program should run and produce a compiled grammar file `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\compile\resources\test\test_c.ecr`.

```sh
> edktool list "..\resources\test\test_c.ecr"

Eduction EDKTool Utility v25.4.0
Loading resource file:
..\resources\test\test_c.ecr


Grammar version:        4.0

Compiled using Edktool: 25.4.0

Listing entities:
test/two_words

0.289 seconds elapsed
```

For extra credit, try `compile` on other Named Entity Recognition grammar XML.

Review the `compile` C source code to gain more insights into how to incorporate the Named Entity Recognition SDK C API into your application.

### `redaction`

In some use cases for Named Entity Recognition, producing redacted text that masks the match values can be of value

The `redaction` sample program accepts a configuration file as you've been using in the other Named Entity Recognition lessons, an UTF-8 text file and a path to the redacted TXT file.

#### Sample `redaction` code

The C sample `redaction` application code lives in: `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\redaction\c`.

#### Build `redaction`

Open the folder `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\redaction\c` in Visual Studio. Visual Studio may take some time interpreting and using the provided `CMakeLists.txt`.

In the "Solution Explorer" view, right-click on the modified "CMakeLists.txt" and click "Build".  You can proceed if you get `Build succeeded.`

#### Run `redaction`

Run your compiled program from the command prompt:

> NOTE: Be sure your PATH environment variable has the full path to your %EDK_HOME%\bin so that `edk.dll` can be found as shown below:

```sh
> set PATH=C:\Opentext\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\bin;%PATH%
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\redaction\c
> out\build\x64-Debug\redaction.exe "..\resources\test\config\basic.cfg" "..\resources\test\input\input.txt" "..\resources\test\redacted.EDK.TXT"
Program loaded.
Config:  ..\resources\test\config\basic.cfg
Document Path: ..\resources\test\input\input.txt
Output File: ..\resources\test\redacted.EDK.TXT
Info: Parameters valid.
Engine created.
Results will be printed to ..\resources\test\redacted.EDK.TXT...
Program completed without an error.
```

The program should run and produce a text file `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\compile\resources\test\redacted.EDK.TXT` with the matches redacted.

For extra credit, try `redaction` with the other configuration file `entity_name.cfg`.

Review the `redaction` C source code to gain more insights into how to incorporate the Named Entity Recognition SDK C API into your application.

## Conclusion

You now understand the basics of the Named Entity Recognition SDK C API.
