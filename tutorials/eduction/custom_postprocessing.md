# Custom Post Processing

In other Named Entity Recognition lessons the OOTB `*_postprocessing.lua` scripts are used as is required with these grammars. Various functions are performed within these scripts like checksum and other match value validation, score normalization and output normalization.  There are other valuable use cases for Named Entity Recognition post-processing.

Refer to the [Named Entity Recognition User and Programming Guide - Post-Processing](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/UseEduction/PostProcessing/LuaPostProcessing.htm) section for more information on this topic.

In this lesson, other uses for post processing will be explored:

- custom redaction of credit card numbers
- entity specific post-process score threshold

## Lessons

### Custom redaction of credit card numbers

While Named Entity Recognition supports redaction of match values in the output text, there are some use cases where special redaction can be valuable. For credit card #'s, the first few digits are generic and related to the issuer with the last few digits also generally preserved.  By removing the middle digits, the credit card # effectively becomes unusable. An example of the redaction looks like the following:

```txt
4012 8888 8888 1881

4012 xxxx xxxx 1881
````

> NOTE: This lesson uses the PCI entity `pci/pan/context/pan` (pci_numbers.ecr) but the same approach works with General entity `number/cc` (number_cc.ecr) with no changes to the Lua script.

The `pci_pan_redact.lua` works with the `pci/pan/*context/pan` entity in the pci_numbers.ecr. It should be configured to run after pci_postprocessing.lua as is done in `config/redact_account_nbr.cfg`.  With some simple regular expressions, the middle digits of the credit card number will be replaced with the value in `redaction_character`.  This Lua script works for most PAN # forms as per the RegEx in `regex_match()`.

```lua
local redaction_character = "x"

function processmatch (edkmatch)
    if edkmatch then
  local text = edkmatch:getMatchedText()
  local first, middle, last = regex_match(text, "(\\d{4})(.*)(\\d{4})")
  middle = regex_replace_all(middle, "\\d", redaction_character)
  
  edkmatch:setOutputText(first .. middle .. last) 
 end
 
 return true
end
```

> NOTE: The Named Entity Recognition provided Lua functions - [regex_match()](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/NiFiIngest_25.4_Documentation/Help/Content/Lua/General/_LUA_regex_match.htm) and  [regex_replace_all()](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/NiFiIngest_25.4_Documentation/Help/Content/Lua/General/_LUA_regex_replace_all.htm) are the keys to implementing the custom redaction. 


Run the provided example

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionGrammars_25.4.0_COMMON\pci\edk_samples\resources
> edktool.exe extract -l ..\..\..\..\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\licensekey.dat -c redact_account_nbr\config\redact_account_nbr.cfg -i redact_account_nbr\input\input.txt
```

Two matches are produced:

```xml
...
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<MATCHLIST>
  <DOCUMENT Type="Plaintext" ID="Unknown">
    <MATCH EntityName="pci/pan/nocontext/pan" Offset="1" OffsetLength="1" Score="1" NormalizedTextSize="19" NormalizedTextLength="19" OriginalTextSize="19" OriginalTextLength="19">
      <ORIGINAL_TEXT>4012 8888 8888 1881</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
      <NORMALIZED_TEXT>4012 xxxx xxxx 1881</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
    </MATCH>
    <MATCH EntityName="pci/pan/nocontext/pan" Offset="22" OffsetLength="22" Score="1" NormalizedTextSize="16" NormalizedTextLength="16" OriginalTextSize="16" OriginalTextLength="16">
      <ORIGINAL_TEXT>4012888888881881</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
      <NORMALIZED_TEXT>4012xxxxxxxx1881</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
    </MATCH>
  </DOCUMENT>
</MATCHLIST>
Entity search completed (T+0.157 seconds)

0.157 seconds elapsed
```

Notice that the `<NORMALIZED_TEXT>` has the redacted representation of the matching credit card number with only the middle digits affected.  If `edktool redact` was used then the entire credit number would be redacted.

### Entity specific post-process score threshold

While Named Entity Recognition supports entity specific scoring via `EntityMinScore#`, this score is applied after the ECR/EJR processing and before the post-processing stage. The `PostProcessThreshold` applies to all entities. Refer to [Named Entity Recognition User and Programming Guide - PostProcessThreshold](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/Configuration/Eduction/_EDU_PostProcessThreshold.htm) section of the Named Entity Recognition User and Programming Guide for more information on this topic. 

This part of the lesson will illustrate how to use a post-processing Lua script to implement an entity specific PostProcessThreshold.

Different `PostProcessThreshold` values per entity allows for use cases like different precision for a particular country within an entity category or similar across entity categories. In this example, we will filter out lower confidence matches of the US SSN (when there's no delimiter) and preserve higher confidence matches (with space or - delimiter), similar for the Argentinian national id number and allow for standard matching of other country national id numbers.

Run the following commands to see the output:

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionGrammars_25.4.0_COMMON\pii\edk_samples\resources
> edktool.exe extract -l ..\..\..\..\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\licensekey.dat -c custom_pp_threshold\config\custom_pp_threshold.cfg -i custom_pp_threshold\input\input.txt -o out_custom_pp_threshold.xml
```

The following matches are produced

```xml
...
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<MATCHLIST>
  <DOCUMENT Type="Plaintext" ID="Unknown">
    <MATCH EntityName="pii/id/nocontext/us" Offset="8" OffsetLength="8" Score="0.5" NormalizedTextSize="11" NormalizedTextLength="11" OriginalTextSize="11" OriginalTextLength="11">
      <ORIGINAL_TEXT>343-55-8575</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
      <NORMALIZED_TEXT>343-55-8575</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
    </MATCH>
    <MATCH EntityName="pii/id/nocontext/us" Offset="20" OffsetLength="20" Score="0.45" NormalizedTextSize="11" NormalizedTextLength="11" OriginalTextSize="11" OriginalTextLength="11">
      <ORIGINAL_TEXT>241 53 8573</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
      <NORMALIZED_TEXT>241 53 8573</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
    </MATCH>
    <MATCH EntityName="pii/id/nocontext/al" Offset="123" OffsetLength="123" Score="0.5" NormalizedTextSize="10" NormalizedTextLength="10" OriginalTextSize="10" OriginalTextLength="10">
      <ORIGINAL_TEXT>I05101999Q</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
      <NORMALIZED_TEXT>I05101999Q</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
      <COMPONENTS>
        <COMPONENT Name="NID" Text="I05101999Q" Offset="0" OffsetLength="0" TextSize="10" TextLength="10"/>
      </COMPONENTS>
    </MATCH>
    <MATCH EntityName="pii/id/nocontext/ar" Offset="212" OffsetLength="212" Score="0.475" NormalizedTextSize="8" NormalizedTextLength="8" OriginalTextSize="8" OriginalTextLength="8">
      <ORIGINAL_TEXT>22691903</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
      <NORMALIZED_TEXT>22691903</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
    </MATCH>
    <MATCH EntityName="pii/id/nocontext/au" Offset="252" OffsetLength="252" Score="0.75" NormalizedTextSize="9" NormalizedTextLength="9" OriginalTextSize="9" OriginalTextLength="9">
      <ORIGINAL_TEXT>AMS123456</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
      <NORMALIZED_TEXT>AMS123456</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
      <COMPONENTS>
        <COMPONENT Name="IMMICARD" Text="AMS123456" Offset="0" OffsetLength="0" TextSize="9" TextLength="9"/>
      </COMPONENTS>
    </MATCH>
  </DOCUMENT>
</MATCHLIST>
Entity search completed (T+1.004 seconds)

1.008 seconds elapsed
```

Edit the `custom_pp_threshold/config/custom_pp_threshold.cfg` to remove the second post process task

```diff
+//PostProcessingTask1 = custom_pp_threshold
```

and re-run the same edktool command as above, but with `-o out_no_custom_pp_threshold.xml`. You will get different (more) matches - with `PostProcessThreshold=0.4` when the custom_pp_threshold task is disabled.

The `custom_pp_threshold/scripts/custom_pp_threshold.lua` provides the framework for this solution and allows for it to be easily extended for use with other grammars and entities.

### Custom Validation and Match Window

Named Entity Recognition supports validation of matches via the PostProcessing Tasks where the licensed grammar packs include scripts for this purpose. However, there are circumstances where custom validation is helpful to further reduce false positives.

Named Entity Recognition 25.4 introduced a new feature that allows for a configurable window of text around the match to be available in the PostProcessing task Lua using `edkmatch:getMatchContext()`. The `custom_validation.lua` script explores how the match context data can be used for extra validation and also to optionally return a contextual match window.

The sample document `custom_validation\extras\custom_validation.docx` was crafted for this lesson and has made up PII, PCI and PHI values in various forms of visible text (*e.g.* header, footer, table and body text) and in hidden text (*e.g.* comments). `custom_validation\input\custom_validation.docx.KV_TEXT.TXT` was generated with KeyView Filter SDK `filter -sh -h` with

```ini
[Options] 
TabDelimited=TRUE
OutputTableDelimiters=TRUE
```
as documented in the [Tab Delimited Output for Spreadsheets and Embedded Tables](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/KeyviewFilterSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/Content/filter/Tab_Delimited_Output.htm) section of KeyView Programming Guide.

The match window as returned by [getMatchContext()](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/Reference/LuaMethods/getMatchContext.htm) is configurable in Named Entity Recognition Engine [configuration](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/Configuration/Eduction/_EDU_ContextCharsBeforeMatch.htm) via the following settings:
```ini
[Eduction] 
...
ContextCharsBeforeMatch = 30
ContextCharsAfterMatch = 30
...
PostProcessingTask2 = custom_validation
...
[custom_validation]
Type = lua
Script = ./custom_validation/scripts/custom_validation.lua
Entities = *
```
The `custom_validation\config\custom_validation.cfg` enables these settings and also incorporates `custom_validation.lua`.  Otherwise, the contents of `custom_validation.cfg` should look familiar.  The enabled resourcesFiles and entities are configured for Mixed Mode as described in [Configure Mixed Table and Free Text Entities](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/UseEduction/ImproveMatches/Extract_Table_Data.htm#Configure-Mixed-).  This allows for matches to occur in the tables, body text and comments.

The `custom_validation\scripts\custom_validation.lua` employs two validation techniques:

1. detection of all numeric entity and check if match is part of a floating point number.
2. invalid_*_regex[] table - where the key is the entity name and the value is a RegEx pattern that if matches will result in an invalid match, return false and thus not return the match.  Adding more entries to `invalid_*_regex[]` is intended and refining / optimizing the RegEx patterns is expected.

> NOTE: There are Lua `print()` statements incorporated thru out `custom_validation.lua` to help illustrate and trace the behavior. Reference the various comments in `custom_validation.lua` for insights into the overall intent and specific nuances of the script. The `print()` statements are intended for use with this tutorial and should be removed or commented out for production use.

Run the following commands to see the output:

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionGrammars_25.4.0_COMMON\pii\edk_samples\resources
> edktool.exe extract -l ..\..\..\..\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\licensekey.dat -c custom_validation\config\custom_validation.cfg -i custom_validation\input\custom_validation.docx.KV_TEXT.TXT -o custom_validation.xml
```

> NOTE: The Lua `print()` statements can be uncommented to help you follow along for each match and the entity specific filtering of false positives.

Re-run the above but with the following change to `custom_validation.cfg`:

```diff
+//PostProcessingTask2 = custom_validation
```

and set the output of `edktool` to `-o no_custom_validation.xml` so you can see the impact of the `custom_validation.lua` task.

There will be less matches in `custom_validation.xml` due to the entity specific patterns aim to reduce false positives in the scenarios in `custom_validation.lua`.

The alternate scenario covered in `custom_validation.lua` is adding the EDK Component `MATCH_CONTEXT` to match object.  By doing so the application call EDK has access to the match context, text before and after the match.  Another use case for `MATCH_CONTEXT` is present this contextual snippet to the user interpreting the match results.

## Conclusion

You are now familiar with more use cases for Named Entity Recognition post processing: custom match redaction, custom score threshold, custom validation.

Next, why not try more tutorials to explore some of the other features available in Named Entity Recognition, linked from [here](../eduction/README.md#capability-showcase).
