# Named Entity Recognition SDK Java API

The Named Entity Recognition SDK is designed to be embedded into other services. To facilitate embedding, the Named Entity Recognition SDK has APIs for C, Java and .NET.  In addition, the Named Entity Recognition SDK runs natively on the following platforms: Windows (x86_64, x86_32 and ARM_64), Linux (x86_64 and ARM_64) and MacOS (x86_64 and Apple M*).

In this lesson, you will:

- use the Named Entity Recognition SDK Java API to perform extraction using a configuration file
- use the Named Entity Recognition SDK Java API to compile a grammar XML into an ECR

The [Named Entity Recognition User and Programming Guide](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/EductionSDK/APIReference/Java_APIConcepts.htm) has sections on this topic which will be referenced in this lesson.

> NOTE: This lesson only covers the Named Entity Recognition SDK APIs and does not cover Named Entity Recognition Server. See [here](./README.md#use-named-entity-recognition-server) for a lesson on Named Entity Recognition Server.

> NOTE: This guide assumes you have already completed the introductory Named Entity Recognition [tutorial](../eduction/introduction.md).

Example programs (with resources) ship with the `EductionSDK_<VERSION>_<PLATFORM>.zip` and `EductionGrammars_<VERSION>_COMMON.zip`.  The sample programs cover topics:

- performing different types of extraction / redaction.
- compiling an XML grammar into an ECR file

### `eduction_from_config`

The `eduction_from_config` sample program accepts a configuration file as you've been using in the other Named Entity Recognition lessons, an UTF-8 text file, a path to the output JSON file and some optional arguments to override the configuration.

#### Sample `eduction_from_config` code

The Java sample `eduction_from_config` application code lives in: `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\java`.

#### Build `eduction_from_config`

Go ahead and build `eduction_from_config`.  A Windows batch file `run_mvn_test.bat` is provided.

> NOTE: Before proceeding make sure the `EDK_HOME`, `MAVEN_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` are correct for your environment.

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_x86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\java
> run_mvn_test.bat 
```

Check the `mvn_test.log` for any errors and `BUILD SUCCESS`.

#### Run `eduction_from_config`

Go ahead and run `eduction_from_config`.  A Windows batch file `run_test.bat` is provided.

> NOTE: Before proceeding make sure the `EDK_HOME`, `MAVEN_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` are correct for your environment.

> NOTE: `eduction_from_config` expects the `idol-oem-tutorials\resources\eduction\sdk\samples\eduction_from_config\resources\test\config\test_session.cfg` to be deployed.

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_x86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\java
> run_test.bat
Feb 26, 2025.4:04:52 PM com.autonomy.eduction.samples.FromConfig$Args <init>

```

Review `educed.EDK.JSON` to see the match information. The program should run and produce an output file containing two matches, as follows:

```json
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "matched_text": "foo bar",
      "entity_name": "test/two_words",
      "offset": 12,
      "offset_length": 12,
      "matched_text_length": 7,
      "matched_text_size": 7,
      "normalized_text": "foo bar",
      "normalized_text_length": 7,
      "normalized_text_size": 7,
      "score": 1.00,
      "components": [
        {
          "name": "FIRST",
          "normalized_text": "foo",
          "normalized_text_length": 3,
          "normalized_text_size": 3,
          "normalized_text_offset": 0,
          "normalized_text_offset_length": 0
        },
        {
          "name": "SECOND",
          "normalized_text": "bar",
          "normalized_text_length": 3,
          "normalized_text_size": 3,
          "normalized_text_offset": 4,
          "normalized_text_offset_length": 4
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "matched_text": "baz bah",
      "entity_name": "test/two_words",
      "offset": 20,
      "offset_length": 20,
      "matched_text_length": 7,
      "matched_text_size": 7,
      "normalized_text": "baz bah",
      "normalized_text_length": 7,
      "normalized_text_size": 7,
      "score": 1.00,
      "components": [
        {
          "name": "FIRST",
          "normalized_text": "baz",
          "normalized_text_length": 3,
          "normalized_text_size": 3,
          "normalized_text_offset": 0,
          "normalized_text_offset_length": 0
        },
        {
          "name": "SECOND",
          "normalized_text": "bah",
          "normalized_text_length": 3,
          "normalized_text_size": 3,
          "normalized_text_offset": 4,
          "normalized_text_offset_length": 4
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

For extra credit, try `eduction_from_config` on other Named Entity Recognition configurations, insuring that configuration file paths are correct.

Review the `eduction_from_config` Java source code to gain more insights into how to incorporate the Named Entity Recognition SDK Java API into your application.

### `compile`

In some use cases for Named Entity Recognition, custom grammars either for net-new entities and/or extending the entities in the licensed grammar packs.

> NOTE: While the Named Entity Recognition SDK engine does support XML based resource files, pre-compiling them into ECRs is recommended.

#### Sample `compile` code

The C sample `compile` application code lives in: `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\compile\java`.

#### Build `compile`

Go ahead and build `compile`.  A Windows batch file `run_mvn_test.bat` is provided.

> NOTE: Before proceeding make sure the `EDK_HOME`, `MAVEN_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` are correct for your environment.

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_x86_64\samples\compile\java
> run_mvn_test.bat 
```

Check the `mvn_test.log` for any errors and `BUILD SUCCESS`.

#### Run `compile`

Go ahead and run `compile`.  A Windows batch file `run_test.bat` is provided.

> NOTE: Before proceeding make sure the `EDK_HOME`, `MAVEN_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` are correct for your environment.

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_x86_64\samples\compile\java

```

A `test.ecr` from the `src/test.xml` source should be generated. To verify the compilation and check which entities are declared as public, let's list the ECRs contents.

```sh
> edktool.exe list -a test.ecr

Eduction EDKTool Utility v25.4.0
Loading resource file:
test.ecr


Grammar version:        4.0

Compiled using Edktool: 25.4.0

Listing entities:
test/two_words
    components: "FIRST" "SECOND"

Listing all necessary requirements for license:
    (none)

0.018 seconds elapsed
```

For extra credit, try `compile` on other Named Entity Recognition grammar XML.

Review the `compile` Java source code to gain more insights into how to incorporate the Named Entity Recognition SDK Java API into your application.

### `redaction`

In some use cases for Eduction, custom grammars either for net-new entities and/or extending the entities in the licensed grammar packs.

> NOTE: While the Named Entity Recognition SDK engine does support XML based resource files, pre-compiling them into ECRs is recommended.

The `redaction` sample program accepts a configuration file as you've been using in the other Named Entity Recognition lessons, an UTF-8 text file and a path to the redacted TXT file.

#### Build `redaction`

Go ahead and build `redaction`.  A Windows batch file `run_mvn_test.bat` is provided.

> NOTE: Before proceeding make sure the `EDK_HOME`, `MAVEN_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` are correct for your environment.

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_x86_64\samples\redaction\java
> run_mvn_test.bat 
```

Check the `mvn_test.log` for any errors and `BUILD SUCCESS`.

#### Run `redaction`

Go ahead and run `redaction`.  A Windows batch file `run_test.bat` is provided.

> NOTE: Before proceeding make sure the `EDK_HOME`, `MAVEN_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` are correct for your environment.

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_x86_64\samples\redaction\java
> run_test.bat
Apr 08, 2024 4:06:48 PM com.autonomy.eduction.samples.Redact redact
INFO: Parameters valid.
Apr 08, 2024 4:06:48 PM com.autonomy.eduction.samples.Redact redact
INFO: Read license.
Apr 08, 2024 4:06:48 PM com.autonomy.eduction.samples.Redact redact
INFO: Engine created.
Apr 08, 2024 4:06:48 PM com.autonomy.eduction.samples.Redact redact
INFO: Printing result to test_redact_java.txt ...
Apr 08, 2024 4:06:48 PM com.autonomy.eduction.samples.Redact redact
INFO: Program completed without error
```

A `redacted.EDK.TXT` should be generated and have the same output as in the `..\resources\test\expectations\redaction.txt`.

For extra credit, try `redaction` with the other Named Entity Recognition configuration file `entity_name.cfg`.

Review the `redaction` Java source code to gain more insights into how to incorporate the Named Entity Recognition SDK Java API into your application.

## Conclusion

You now understand the basics of the Named Entity Recognition SDK Java API.

As extra credit, build and run the other sample programs in `EductionSDK_<VERSION>_<PLATFORM>\samples` and `EductionGrammars_<VERSION>_COMMON\pii\edk_samples`.  Refer to the changes in these resources and leverage the build tools & tips.
