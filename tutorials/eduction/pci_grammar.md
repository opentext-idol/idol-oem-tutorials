# Use PCI Named Entity Recognition grammars

The Named Entity Recognition PCI Package contains tools that allow you to locate Payment Card Industry (PCI) in your data, to help you comply with financial regulations.

In this lesson, you will:

- Explore and use the out-of-the-box PCI grammars.
- Gain deeper understanding of checksum validation.

> NOTE: This guide assumes you have already completed the introductory Named Entity Recognition [tutorial](./introduction.md).

## Setup

Before you continue with this lesson, refer to the [documentation links](#see-also) below.

> NOTE: This lesson assumes you have already completed the [Named Entity Recognition SDK introduction](../eduction/introduction.md) lesson covering essential setup steps (*e.g.* required downloads and installation steps) and basic Named Entity Recognition concepts.

### Resources

Be sure to download the following resources before you continue:
- [PCI edk_samples](../../resources/eduction/pci/edk_samples) and install to `C:\OpenText\EductionGrammars_25.4.0_COMMON\pci\edk_samples\resources`

## What's in the Box?

The Named Entity Recognition PCI Package includes Named Entity Recognition Grammar files, post-processing scripts (*e.g.* checksum & additional validation, output & score normalization and filtering) for certain entities.

### Available Grammar Files

To review which grammar files are included, list the directory `C:\OpenText\EductionGrammars_25.4.0_COMMON\pci`. The command `edktool list -a <grammar>.ecr ` can be used to explore the public entities, available components and license requirements. Or open the `pci_entities.html` file in your web browser. This `.html` file conveniently lists available entities by locale as well as grammar file name.

The PCI Grammar Package covers name (for many countries), date and account number variations specific to the PCI use case.

### Types of Entities

The PCI grammar files provide entities of the "context", "nocontext" and "landmark" forms like the PII, PHI and Gov packages do.

For the PCI date entities, like `pci/date/paymentcard/*`, "context", "nocontext" and 'landmark" options are available in order to match the recall and precision goals to the use case.  Consider that the "nocontext" version might over-match significantly (*i.e.*, we are likely to return values that are similar to the entity patterns, such as a date of birth).

The PCI number entities, like `pci/pan/*/pan`, there are also "context", "nocontext" and "landmark" entity forms. However, the "nocontext" form has less risk of false positives due to checksum validation which we will explore below.

For full details of the entities included in the PCI Grammar Package, please reference the [Named Entity Recognition Grammars Users Guide - PCI Grammars](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionGrammars_25.4_Documentation/Help/Content/PCI/PCI_Intro.htm).

> NOTE: You can configure Named Entity Recognition to use either versions of an entity, in which case matches located with context are given a higher score in the results.

## PAN (Personal Account Number) Matching

Let's try this out now to see what information is returned from a PAN match.

In the setup, you deployed PCI edk_samples resources, which can be used with the Named Entity Recognition APIs and `edktool`: `pci\edk_samples\resources\account_nbr\config\account_nbr.cfg`.

Run the following commands to see the output:

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionGrammars_25.4.0_COMMON\pci\edk_samples\resources
> edktool.exe extract -l ..\..\..\..\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\licensekey.dat -c account_nbr\config\account_nbr.cfg -i account_nbr\input\input.txt -o out.xml
```

32 matches are found representing a landmark plus 31 personal account numbers out of 32 potential credit card numbers.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<MATCHLIST>
  <DOCUMENT Type="Plaintext" ID="Unknown">
    <MATCH EntityName="pci/pan/landmark/pan" Offset="61" OffsetLength="61" Score="1" NormalizedTextSize="11" NormalizedTextLength="11" OriginalTextSize="11" OriginalTextLength="11">
      <ORIGINAL_TEXT>Card Number</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
      <NORMALIZED_TEXT>card number</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
    </MATCH>
    <MATCH EntityName="pci/pan/nocontext/pan" Offset="144" OffsetLength="144" Score="1" NormalizedTextSize="15" NormalizedTextLength="15" OriginalTextSize="15" OriginalTextLength="15">
      <ORIGINAL_TEXT>378282246310005</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
      <NORMALIZED_TEXT>378282246310005</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
    </MATCH>
    <MATCH EntityName="pci/pan/nocontext/pan" Offset="181" OffsetLength="181" Score="1" NormalizedTextSize="15" NormalizedTextLength="15" OriginalTextSize="15" OriginalTextLength="15">
      <ORIGINAL_TEXT>371449635398431</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
      <NORMALIZED_TEXT>371449635398431</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
    </MATCH>
    ...
  </DOCUMENT>
</MATCHLIST>
```

You might ask why only 31 out of 32?  Per the sample data in `account_nbr\input\input.txt`, the reason is simple:

1. the last example in `input.txt` matches the American Express regex (leading digits and length).  However, it is blocked at the post-processing validation stage, which performs a checksum validation using the Luhn algorithm.  While the PAN does have limiting regex patterns (by length and digit combinations), it is possible to encounter numbers that look like a PAN, but are not. By doing a checksum validation on the matching string of digits, false positive matches are reduced.

As an extra credit exercise, you can edit `account_nbr\config\account_nbr.cfg` commenting out the pci_postprocessing task:

```diff
[Eduction]
- PostProcessingTask0 = pci_postprocessing
+ //PostProcessingTask0 = pci_postprocessing
```

Then re-run `edktool extract` as above but output to `-o out2.xml` so you can compare the results. There will be 33 matches this time: 1 landmark and 32 PANs.

## Run PCI All Example Matching

In the setup, you deployed edk_samples resources.  It contains resources to be used with the Named Entity Recognition SDK APIs and `edktool`: `pci\edk_samples\resources\pci_all\config\pci_all.cfg`.

Run the following commands to see the output:

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionGrammars_25.4.0_COMMON\pci\edk_samples\resources
> edktool.exe extract -l ..\..\..\..\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\licensekey.dat -c pci_all\config\pci_all.cfg -i pci_all\input\input.txt -o out.xml
```

The `pci_all.cfg` configuration and `input.txt` represent all available entity categories in the PCI package, but does intentionally select "nocontext" vs "context" for particular entity categories.

## Conclusion

You now understand how to explore and use the Named Entity Recognition's PCI grammars and an example of how the post processing stage of Named Entity Recognition matching is very valuable. Other entity categories like PII national_id & tin, PHI device UDI & DEA # and GOV Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) do checksum based validation to improve match precision.

Next, why not try more tutorials to explore some of the other features available in Named Entity Recognition, linked from [here](../eduction/README.md#capability-showcase).
