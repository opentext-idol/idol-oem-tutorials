# Named Entity Recognition SDK .NET API

The Named Entity Recognition SDK is designed to be embedded into other services. To facilitate embedding, the Named Entity Recognition SDK has APIs for C, Java and .NET.  In addition, the Named Entity Recognition SDK runs natively on the following platforms: Windows (x86_64, x86_32 and ARM_64), Linux (x86_64 and ARM_64) and MacOS (x86_64 and Apple M*).

In this lesson, you will:

- use the Named Entity Recognition SDK .NET API to perform extraction using a configuration file
- use the Named Entity Recognition SDK .NET API to compile a grammar XML into an ECR

The [Named Entity Recognition User and Programming Guide](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/EductionSDK/APIReference/DotNet_APIConcepts.htm) has sections on this topic which will be referenced in this lesson.

> NOTE: This lesson only covers the Named Entity Recognition SDK APIs and does not cover Named Entity Recognition Server. See [here](./README.md#use-named-entity-recognition-server) for a lesson on Named Entity Recognition Server.

> NOTE: This guide assumes you have already completed the introductory Named Entity Recognition [tutorial](../eduction/introduction.md).

## API Documentation

API specific documentation is located in sub-folders of `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\` as noted below:

- .NET - `dotnet_api\help\index.html`

## Example programs

Example programs (with resources) ship with the `EductionSDK_<VERSION>_<PLATFORM>.zip` and `EductionGrammars_<VERSION>_COMMON.zip`.  The sample programs cover topics:

- performing different types of extraction / redaction.
- compiling an XML grammar into an ECR file

### `eduction_from_config`

The `eduction_from_config` sample program accepts a configuration file as you've been using in the other Named Entity Recognition lessons, an UTF-8 text file, a path to the output JSON file and some optional arguments to override the configuration.

#### Sample `eduction_from_config` code

The C# sample `eduction_from_config` application code lives in: `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\dotnet`.

Double-click on the `eduction_from_config.csproj` to open the sample code, *e.g.* in Visual Studio 2022.

#### Build `eduction_from_config`

In the top menu bar, click the green play icon to build the project in debug mode:

![vs_2022_dotnet_debug_build](./figs/vs_2022_dotnet_debug_build.png)

After successfully building, the application will automatically run.

You will see an error message to explain that the sample application expects to received some input options to run:

![vs_2022_dotnet_debug_run](./figs/vs_2022_dotnet_debug_run.png)

#### Run `eduction_from_config`

Let's provide the required input options and run in debug mode again.

- Click the debug properties menu option to open the "Launch Profiles" window:
    ![vs_2022_dotnet_debug_props_menu](./figs/vs_2022_dotnet_debug_props_menu.png)

    > NOTE: This sample application comes with a resources folder containing test files, which we will use, located *e.g.* at `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\resources\test`.

- In the "Command line arguments" input box, enter the following three paths (separated onto new lines):

    ```sh
    "..\resources\test\config\test.cfg"
    "..\resources\test\input\input.txt"
    "..\resources\test\test_output_dotnet.json"
    ```

- In the "Working directory" input box, enter the following path:

    ```sh
    C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\dotnet
    ```

    ![vs_2022_dotnet_debug_props_cmd](./figs/vs_2022_dotnet_debug_props_cmd.png)

- Close the "Launch Profiles" window.
  
- In the top menu bar, again click the green play icon to re-build the project in debug mode.
  
    ![vs_2022_dotnet_debug_run2](./figs/vs_2022_dotnet_debug_run2.png)

This time the program should run and produce an output file `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\resources\test\test_output_dotnet.json` containing two matches, as follows:

```json
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "matched_text": "foo bar",
      "entity_name": "test/two_words",
      "offset": 12,
      "offset_length": 12,
      "matched_text_length": 7,
      "matched_text_size": 7,
      "normalized_text": "foo bar",
      "normalized_text_length": 7,
      "normalized_text_size": 7,
      "score": 1.00,
      "components": [
        {
          "name": "FIRST",
          "normalized_text": "foo",
          "normalized_text_length": 3,
          "normalized_text_size": 3,
          "normalized_text_offset": 0,
          "normalized_text_offset_length": 0
        },
        {
          "name": "SECOND",
          "normalized_text": "bar",
          "normalized_text_length": 3,
          "normalized_text_size": 3,
          "normalized_text_offset": 4,
          "normalized_text_offset_length": 4
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "matched_text": "baz bah",
      "entity_name": "test/two_words",
      "offset": 20,
      "offset_length": 20,
      "matched_text_length": 7,
      "matched_text_size": 7,
      "normalized_text": "baz bah",
      "normalized_text_length": 7,
      "normalized_text_size": 7,
      "score": 1.00,
      "components": [
        {
          "name": "FIRST",
          "normalized_text": "baz",
          "normalized_text_length": 3,
          "normalized_text_size": 3,
          "normalized_text_offset": 0,
          "normalized_text_offset_length": 0
        },
        {
          "name": "SECOND",
          "normalized_text": "bah",
          "normalized_text_length": 3,
          "normalized_text_size": 3,
          "normalized_text_offset": 4,
          "normalized_text_offset_length": 4
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

For extra credit, try `eduction_from_config` on other Named Entity Recognition configurations, insuring that configuration file paths are correct.

Review the `eduction_from_config` C# source code to gain more insights into how to incorporate the Named Entity Recognition SDK .NET API into your application.

### `compile`

In some use cases for Named Entity Recognition, custom grammars either for net-new entities and/or extending the entities in the licensed grammar packs.

> NOTE: While the Named Entity Recognition SDK engine does support XML based resource files, pre-compiling them into ECRs is recommended.

The `compile` sample program accepts a grammar XML and output ECR.

#### Sample `compile` code

The C# sample `compile` application code lives in: `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\compile\dotnet`.

Double-click on the `compile.csproj` to open the sample code, *e.g.* in Visual Studio 2022.

#### Build and run `compile`

- In the top menu bar, click next to the green play icon to open the dropdown options menu:

    ![vs_2022_dotnet_debug_options](./figs/vs_2022_dotnet_debug_options.png)

- Click the debug properties menu option to open the "Launch Profiles" window:
  
    > NOTE: This sample application comes with a resources folder containing test files, which we will use, located *e.g.* at `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\compile\resources\test`.

- In the "Command line arguments" input box, enter the following three paths (separated onto new lines):

    ```sh
    "..\resources\test\source\test.xml"
    "..\resources\test\test_dotnet.ecr"
    ```

- In the "Working directory" input box, enter the following path:

    ```sh
    C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\compile\dotnet
    ```

    ![vs_2022_dotnet_debug_props_cmd2](./figs/vs_2022_dotnet_debug_props_cmd2.png)

- Close the "Launch Profiles" window.
  
- In the top menu bar, click the green play icon to build and run the project in debug mode.

The program should run and produce a compiled grammar file `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\compile\resources\test\test_dotnet.ecr`.

```sh
> edktool list "..\resources\test\test_dotnet.ecr"

Eduction EDKTool Utility v25.4.0
Loading resource file:
..\resources\test\test_dotnet.ecr


Grammar version:        4.0
