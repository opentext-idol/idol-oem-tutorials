## Setup

Before you continue with this lesson, refer to the [documentation links](#see-also) below.

### Minimum requirements

- 1 core, 1 GB RAM, 5GB free disk space.
- Windows_x86_64, Windows_x86_32, Windows_ARM64, Linux_x86_32, Linux_x86_64, Linux_ARM64, MacOS_x86_64 or MacOS_M*.
- A Knowledge Discovery license key and software access.
- useful third-party tools noted below.

> NOTE: Disk space includes zips, unzipped and generous working space.

> NOTE: The following guide details steps for Windows. Steps will be similar for other supported platforms.

> NOTE: Sizing for your own production tasks depends greatly on your use case, as discussed later in these tutorials.

### Useful third-party tools

- A (UTF-8 capable) text editor, *e.g.*:
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), or
  - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

- A Markdown viewer
  - Plugins to VS Code, Notepad++ and some web browsers are good options

### Knowledge Discovery components

Knowledge Discovery SDKs must embed a license key, which is unique to your project.

To obtain a license key, follow these [steps](../setup/license_key.md), then return here to continue.

#### Download Named Entity Recognition components

Download software from the [Software Licensing and Downloads](https://sld.microfocus.com/mysoftware/index) portal.

1. Under the *Downloads* tab, select your product, product name and version from the dropdowns:

    ![get-software](../../figs/get-software.png)

1. From the list of available files, select and download the following (depending on your platform):
   - `EductionSDK_25.4.0_{PLATFORM}`, *e.g.* `EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64.zip`,
   - `EductionGrammars_25.4.0_COMMON.zip`, and
   - `Versionkey_25.4.0_COMMON.zip`.

#### Install Named Entity Recognition & Grammars

1. Copy your downloaded files into a new working folder.  The follow guide assumes this is `C:\OpenText` on Windows.
2. Extract both of the `.zip` files to give you:
   - `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64`, and
   - `C:\OpenText\EductionGrammars_25.4.0_COMMON`
3. Copy your license key `.dat` file into `C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64` and rename it to `licensekey.dat`
4. Extract the `versionkey.dat` from the `Versionkey_25.4.0_COMMON.zip` and deploy it alongside your license key `.dat` file.

> NOTE: On Windows, you may need to install the included Visual C++ Redistributable package.  In the same EductionSDK folder, right-click on `vcredist.exe` then select 'Run as administrator'. If you see a version conflict error here, you may need to first uninstall any existing version.

See the [Named Entity Recognition User & Programming Guide - Install Named Entity Recognition](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/GettingStarted/Install/Install.htm) for more details.

#### Environment variables

For ease of use, update your environment variables to reference your new EductionSDK.

For Windows, open a command prompt window and enter:

```sh
set PATH=C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\bin;%PATH%
```

A batch file or shell script can be created to make this easier.

Or, from System Properties, add this path to your "PATH" System variable:

![env](./figs/env.png)

> NOTE: If updating to a newer version of EDK, open System Properties and ensure your "Path" variable refers to the latest version only.

## Introduction to Named Entity Recognition

To get oriented with key concepts please read the "Getting Started" section of the [Named Entity Recognition User & Programming Guide](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/part_intro.htm) before continuing.

The following lesson will show you to perform entity extraction.

### Run `edktool`

As our first step, let's run the included binary file `edktool`, then learn how to explore and a grammar ECR file to perform extraction.

Run the `edktool` command line program to yield usage instructions:

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\bin
> edktool.exe

See the [Named Entity Recognition User & Programming Guide - edktool Command-Line Options](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/Reference/edktool/edktoolOptions_intro.htm) for more details.

### Explore contents of grammar ECR file

The Named Entity Recognition SDK package contains useful sample resources, including simple grammar files for testing.

Let's use `edktool`'s `list` function to look at one of these samples.

From the command line, enter the following:

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\resources\test\grammar
> edktool.exe list test.ecr

Eduction EDKTool Utility v25.4.0
Loading resource file:
test.ecr


Grammar version:        4.0

Compiled using Edktool: 12.3.0

Listing entities:
test/two_words

0.024 seconds elapsed
```

We can see that the grammar file defined one public entity, mysteriously named `test/two words`.

> NOTE: `edktool` gives you elapsed time information, which we will find very useful for testing.

To get a bit more detail, re-run the same command with an extra `-a` flag:

```sh
edktool.exe list -a test.ecr
```

The new part of the output is:

```sh
Listing entities:
test/two_words
    components: "FIRST" "SECOND"

Listing all necessary requirements for license:
    (none)
```

This gives more details of the construction of the entities, as well as specific licensing requirements for their use.  

`test.ecr` and the entity `test/two_words` is intentionally generic - matching any combination of two words.

To see an example of a real grammar file, explore the Named Entity Recognition Grammars package, *e.g.*

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionGrammars_25.4.0_COMMON\pii
> edktool.exe list address.ecr          

Eduction EDKTool Utility v25.4.0
Loading resource file:
address.ecr


Grammar version:        4.0

Compiled using Edktool: 25.4.0

Listing entities:
gdpr/address/at
gdpr/address/be
gdpr/address/bg
...
pii/address/tr
pii/address/us
pii/address/za

3.555 seconds elapsed
```

Many of these grammar files contain hundreds of entities, which are typically selectively applied for extraction. Some entities in a given ECR like `address.ecr` are specialized like `pii/address/city/context/CC` or similar where as `pii/address/CC` are general purpose in terms of their typical use.

> NOTE: The Named Entity Recognition PII grammars are backwards-compatible with the GDPR grammars. You can continue to use, *e.g.* the entity named `gdpr/address/at` in existing configurations, which is similar to the latest `pii/address/at` entity.

### Perform a first extraction

From the command line, enter the following:

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\resources
> edktool.exe extract -l ..\..\..\licensekey.dat -c test\config\test.cfg -i test\input\input.txt

The output contains a lot of useful information for testing, including first, a record of the test files and configuration applied, followed by an XML representation of any detected entities, *i.e.* matches.

#### The configuration section

How were these configuration options applied?  Note the `-c test\config\test.cfg` flag used in the above command. This `.cfg` file contain our configuration options.  It is a best practice to control the behavior of the EDKEngine via a configuration file.

Open it on the command line by typing:

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\resources
> type test\config\test.cfg 
```

The format of this configuration file may already be familiar to you if you have used other Knowledge Discovery products.

First, in the `Eduction` section we reference our test `.ecr` grammar file(s) and then specify exactly which entities we want to use.  In this example, all of them, as specified by the `*` are enabled:

```ini
[Eduction]
ResourceFiles = ../resources/test/grammar/test.ecr
TangibleCharacters =
Entity0 = test/*
EntityField0 = TEST
```

We also provide an output name for any matches to these entities, here called "TEST".  Knowledge Discovery components such as [CFS](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/CFS_25.4_Documentation/Help/) make use of EntityField# value.

Further down, in the same `[Eduction]` section, we specify a section of runtime options for the EDKEngine:

```ini
EnableComponents = True
MatchWholeWord = True
AllowMultipleResults = OnePerEntity
EnableUniqueMatches = False
CaseSensitiveFieldName = False
AllowOverlaps = False
NonGreedyMatch = False
MatchCase = True
CaseNormalization = None
CaseNormalizationBehavior = Default
CJKNormalization = Number
MinScore = 0.5

LanguageDirectory = langfiles
```

For full details on these and other options, please reference [Named Entity Recognition User & Programming Guide - Named Entity Recognition Parameter Reference](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/Reference/EductionParameters.htm).

Lastly, an optional post-processing task is configured by referencing a `.lua` script:

```ini
PostProcessingTask0=pptask

[pptask]
Script = ../resources/test/scripts/postprocessing.lua
Entities = *
```

> NOTE: More than one post processing task can be configured.

For an introduction to the Lua language, look no further than [lua.org](https://www.lua.org/).  With Eduction, we use Lua to apply custom logic that can inspect and manipulate matches. Score and output normalization and algorithmic validation of matches (*e.g.* validating checksums) are some example use cases for this feature. The example script referenced above, for example, checks that matches contain fewer than eight characters:

```lua
function processmatch (edkmatch)
  if edkmatch then
    local text = edkmatch:getOutputText()
    if text:len() > 8 then
      return false
    end
    return true
  end
end
```

This example Lua post-processing function receives an object of class [`edkMatch`](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/Reference/LuaMethods/edkmatch.htm). This class provides useful getter and setter methods for access and manipulation of the Educed match (see below).

For more details on Lua post-processing, please reference [Named Entity Recognition User & Programming Guide - Post-Processing](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/UseEduction/PostProcessing/LuaPostProcessing.htm).

#### The match section

Each Educed match provides the following key information:

- Which entity it was matched against.
- The match score, which is a measure of confidence.  The PII, PHI, PCI and Gov grammar packages make extensive use of scoring to indicate confidence.
- The location of the match, i.e. the character offset from the start of the text.
- A normalized version of the matched text, which can be very useful for dates, names, addresses, *etc.*
- Any components to the detection. If this were a name match, this could include a given name, family name and potentially a prefix such as "Mr." or "Mrs".

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<MATCHLIST>
  <DOCUMENT Type="Plaintext" ID="Unknown">
    <MATCH EntityName="test/two_words" Offset="12" OffsetLength="12" Score="1" NormalizedTextSize="7" NormalizedTextLength="7" OriginalTextSize="7" OriginalTextLength="7">
      <ORIGINAL_TEXT>foo bar</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
      <NORMALIZED_TEXT>foo bar</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
      <COMPONENTS>
        <COMPONENT Name="FIRST" Text="foo" Offset="0" OffsetLength="0" TextSize="3" TextLength="3"/>
        <COMPONENT Name="SECOND" Text="bar" Offset="4" OffsetLength="4" TextSize="3" TextLength="3"/>
      </COMPONENTS>
    </MATCH>
    <MATCH EntityName="test/two_words" Offset="20" OffsetLength="20" Score="1" NormalizedTextSize="7" NormalizedTextLength="7" OriginalTextSize="7" OriginalTextLength="7">
      <ORIGINAL_TEXT>baz bah</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
      <NORMALIZED_TEXT>baz bah</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
      <COMPONENTS>
        <COMPONENT Name="FIRST" Text="baz" Offset="0" OffsetLength="0" TextSize="3" TextLength="3"/>

      </COMPONENTS>
    </MATCH>
  </DOCUMENT>
</MATCHLIST>
```

Next, we will modify our command line options to send the match results to an `.xml` file:

```sh
> cd C:\OpenText\EductionSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64\samples\eduction_from_config\resources
> edktool.exe extract -l ..\..\..\licensekey.dat -c test\config\test.cfg -i test\input\input.txt -o out.xml

#### The grammar source

For the `test` example, the grammar source is provided - `EductionSDK_<VERSION>_<PLATFORM>\samples\eduction_from_config\resources\test\grammar\test.xml`. Let's explore some aspects of it.  The match intent of `test` is simple - find two words separate by a space. But the implementation does illustrate some valuable aspects of the Named Entity Recognition engine grammar syntax:

1. private entity used by another entity
2. components
3. RegEx

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE grammars SYSTEM "../published/edk.dtd">
<grammars version="4.0">
    <grammar name="test">
        <entity name="word" type="private">
            <pattern>\w+</pattern>
        </entity>

        <entity name="two_words" type="public">
            <pattern>(?A=FIRST:(?A:word)) (?A=SECOND:(?A:word))</pattern>
        </entity>
    </grammar>
</grammars>
```

By using the private entity `word`, the `two_words` entity can re-use the `word` entity - in this case 2 times vs. having to explicitly repeat the definition of `word`. In this example, `word` is a trivial pattern. But like in coding, a constant or function with a user friendly name makes a program easier to *understand* and *maintain*. The same is true with the implementation of entities.

The use of components `?A=FIRST:` and `?A=SECOND:` allows for the match data of `two_words` to *identify* and *label* the parts (aka components) of the match:

```xml
<MATCH EntityName="test/two_words" Offset="20" OffsetLength="20" Score="1" NormalizedTextSize="7" NormalizedTextLength="7" OriginalTextSize="7" OriginalTextLength="7">
  <ORIGINAL_TEXT>baz bah</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
  <NORMALIZED_TEXT>baz bah</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
  <COMPONENTS>
    <COMPONENT Name="FIRST" Text="baz" Offset="0" OffsetLength="0" TextSize="3" TextLength="3"/>
    <COMPONENT Name="SECOND" Text="bah" Offset="4" OffsetLength="4" TextSize="3" TextLength="3"/>
  </COMPONENTS>
```

Many of grammars in the `EductionGrammars_<VERSION>_COMMON` make use of components, to aid in post-processing (*e.g.* validation, scoring and output normalization), but also providing transparency into why a match occurred.

## Review

Let's remind ourselves of what we have just done.  Ran `edktool`'s list function and ran `edktool`'s `extract` function with the following inputs:

- `test\config\test.cfg`
- `test\scripts\postprocessing.lua`
- `test\input\input.txt`

matching any combination of two words within the `input.txt`, then post-processing those matches to select only those word pairs with fewer than eight characters in total, using Lua.

From the input text: "Hello world foo bar baz bah", we found two matches:

1. "foo bar":

    ```xml
    <MATCH EntityName="test/two_words" Offset="12" OffsetLength="12" Score="1" NormalizedTextSize="7" NormalizedTextLength="7" OriginalTextSize="7" OriginalTextLength="7">
      <ORIGINAL_TEXT>foo bar</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
      <NORMALIZED_TEXT>foo bar</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
      <COMPONENTS>
        <COMPONENT Name="FIRST" Text="foo" Offset="0" OffsetLength="0" TextSize="3" TextLength="3"/>
        <COMPONENT Name="SECOND" Text="bar" Offset="4" OffsetLength="4" TextSize="3" TextLength="3"/>
      </COMPONENTS>
    </MATCH>
    ```

2. "baz bah":

    ```xml
    <MATCH EntityName="test/two_words" Offset="20" OffsetLength="20" Score="1" NormalizedTextSize="7" NormalizedTextLength="7" OriginalTextSize="7" OriginalTextLength="7">
      <ORIGINAL_TEXT>baz bah</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
      <NORMALIZED_TEXT>baz bah</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
      <COMPONENTS>
        <COMPONENT Name="FIRST" Text="baz" Offset="0" OffsetLength="0" TextSize="3" TextLength="3"/>
        <COMPONENT Name="SECOND" Text="bah" Offset="4" OffsetLength="4" TextSize="3" TextLength="3"/>
      </COMPONENTS>
    </MATCH>
    ```

So, why only these two combinations?

### Rejected matches

The first two words "Hello world" were rejected by post-processing because the total length of the pair is 11 characters, *i.e.* more than eight.

To match this word pair, modify your `test.cfg` as follows to disable post-processing:

```diff
[PostProcessingTasks]
- NumTasks = 1
+ NumTasks = 0
```

Now re-run the above command and notice a third match in your output:

```xml
<MATCH EntityName="test/two_words" Offset="0" OffsetLength="0" Score="1" NormalizedTextSize="11" NormalizedTextLength="11" OriginalTextSize="11" OriginalTextLength="11">
  <ORIGINAL_TEXT>Hello world</ORIGINAL_TEXT>
  <NORMALIZED_TEXT>Hello world</NORMALIZED_TEXT>
  <COMPONENTS>
    <COMPONENT Name="FIRST" Text="Hello" Offset="0" OffsetLength="0" TextSize="5" TextLength="5"/>
    <COMPONENT Name="SECOND" Text="world" Offset="6" OffsetLength="6" TextSize="5" TextLength="5"/>
  </COMPONENTS>
</MATCH>
```

### Restricted match combinations

At this point you may now be wondering why six input words resulting in only three output pairs and not five?

Why have the words "A B C D E F" only resulted in three combinations "AB",  "CD" and  "EF"?  What happened to "BC" and "DE"?

```mermaid
graph TD;
  text[A B C D E F]
  one[AB]
  two([BC])
  three[CD]
  four([DE])
  five[EF]
  text --> one
  text -.- two
  text --> three
  text -.- four
  text --> five
```

To understand this restriction, we need to review the configuration parameters applied, specifically:

```ini
AllowOverlaps = False
```

To change this behavior to include overlapping matches and return all five possible in-sequence combinations, modify your `test.cfg` as follows to disable pose-processing:

```diff
[Eduction]
- AllowOverlaps = False
+ AllowOverlaps = True
```

Now re-run the above command to see all five matches in your output.

For full details on this property, please reference [Named Entity Recognition User & Programming Guide - AllowOverlaps](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/EductionSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/Configuration/Eduction/_EDU_AllowOverlaps.htm).
