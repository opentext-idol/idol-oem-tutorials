# .NET ACI API Sample Code

The .NET ACI API sample code resources build upon the information in the [ACI API Programming Guide - .NET Language Interface](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/IDOLJavaSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/NET/NET_part.htm) providing working examples to interact with IDOL ACI services.

The various examples contain source code and build configuration for Visual Studio on Windows_x86_64.

## Setup

Relative paths are used in the provided `do_*` scripts and the Visual Studio project files. They assume the following installation paths:

- `C:\OpenText\idol_oem_tutorials\resources\apis\aci\dotnet`
- `C:\OpenText\IDOLDotNetSDK_25.4.0_WINDOWS_X86_64`

### Setup - Build

To build and then run each example the constants `USE_IDOL_OEM_ENCYPTION` and `IDOL_OEM_ENCRYPTION_KEY` will need to be updated with same encryption key information provided in the `OEMstring.txt` file.

### Setup - Run

In the `do_run_*.*` scripts, the hostname, port and other service specific settings may need to be updated for your ACI service instance.

To use the `/bin/netcoreapp3.1` exe as is the `do_run.*` scripts need to be updated with the encryption key information provided in the `OEMstring.txt` file.  See [here](../../../tutorials/aci_api/introduction.md#obtain-an-oem-license-key) for details on obtaining OEM style license key.

### Required third-party tools

- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

- A (UTF-8 capable) text editor, *e.g.*:
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), or
  - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

- A Markdown viewer
  - Plugins to VS Code, Notepad++ and some web browsers are good options

## getStatus

This sample code is for use with all IDOL services, since `action=getStatus` is an administrative action supported by all IDOL service types.  It can also serve as the foundation for implementing other actions.

## fetch_synchronize

This sample code is for use with IDOL Connectors issuing the basic settings for `action=fetch` and implementing `fetchAction=synchronize`. It can also serve as the foundation for implementing other fetch actions..

> NOTE: The `do_run_fetch_synchronize.bat` script may need to be updated with your configured fetch task name in `TASK_NAME`.

## fetch_identifiers

This sample code is for use with IDOL Connectors issuing the basic settings for `action=fetch` and implementing `fetchAction=identifiers`. It can also serve as the foundation for implementing other fetch actions.

> NOTE: The `do_run_fetch_identifiers.bat` script may need to be updated with your configured fetch task name in `TASK_NAME`.

## fetch_collect

This sample code is for use with IDOL Connectors issuing the basic settings for `action=fetch` and implementing `fetchAction=collect`. It can also serve as the foundation for implementing other fetch actions.

> NOTE: The `do_run_fetch_collect.bat` script will need to be updated with the `IDENTIFIERS_CSV` for the data to collect.

> NOTE: The `do_run_fetch_collect.bat` script may need to updated with the `DESTINATION_FOLDER`.

## fetch_delete

This sample code is for use with IDOL Connectors issuing the basic settings for `action=fetch` and implementing `fetchAction=delete`. It can also serve as the foundation for implementing other fetch actions.

> NOTE: The `do_run_fetch_delete.bat` script will need to be updated with the `IDENTIFIERS_CSV` for the data to collect.

## fetch_insert

This sample code is for use with IDOL Connectors issuing the basic settings for `action=fetch` and implementing `fetchAction=insert`. It can also serve as the foundation for implementing other fetch actions.

> NOTE: The `do_run_fetch_synchronize.bat` script may need to be updated with your configured fetch task name in `TASK_NAME`.

> NOTE: A `insertXML.xml` will need to be updated containing properly formatted `<insertXML>` syntax for the connector being used.  For more details, refer to the documentation for the connector being used.

> NOTE: The `do_run_fetch_insert.bat` script may need to be updated with the `INSERT_XML_FILE` path containing the data to insert.

## fetch_update

This sample code is for use with IDOL Connectors issuing the basic settings for `action=fetch` and implementing `fetchAction=update`. It can also serve as the foundation for implementing other fetch actions.

> NOTE: A `identifiersXML.xml` will need to be updated containing properly formatted `<identifersXML>` syntax for the connector being used.  For more details, refer to the documentation for the connector being used.

> NOTE: The `do_run_fetch_update.bat` script may need to be updated with the `IDENTIFIERS_XML_FILE` path containing the data to update.

## queueInfo_getStatus

This sample code is applicable to all IDOL services (*e.g.* Connectors, CFS, MediaServer and Content) that support asynchronous actions.  `action=queueInfo&queueAction=getStatus` is to get the status.

> NOTE: The `do_run_queueInfo_getstatus.bat` script may need to be updated with the `QUEUE_NAME` appropriate for the IDOL service type in use.  Asynchronous actions are supported by connectors, CFS, MediaServer and other IDOL service types.

> NOTE: The `do_run_queueInfo_getstatus.bat` script will need to be updated with the token returned by asynchronous actions like `action=fetch` to check the status of a particular token.  If the TOKEN variable is set to empty string then recent tokens status will be returned.

## ms_process

This sample code is for use with IDOL Media Server issuing the basic settings for `action=process`.

> NOTE: The `do_run_ms_process.bat` script will need to be updated with the `CONFIG_NAME` appropriate for the intended Media Server processing.  

> NOTE: The `do_run_ms_process.bat` script will need to be updated with the `SOURCE_FILE_PATH` of the rich media file to process.
