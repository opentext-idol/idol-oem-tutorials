# Java ACI API Sample Code

The Java ACI API sample code resources build upon the information in the [ACI API Programming Guide - Java Language Interface](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/knowledge-discovery-25.4/IDOLJavaSDK_25.4_Documentation/Guides/html/Content/Java/java_part.htm) providing working examples to interact with IDOL ACI services.

The various examples contain source code and build scripts for Windows and Linux.

The `/<example>/target` folder is built with [OpenJDK 17](https://openjdk.org/).  This means you can run the sample programs without building them.  However, since the provided exes are built with `USE_IDOL_OEM_ENCRYPTION = true`, the `do_run.*` scripts need to be updated with your issued OEM style license key.

The `/<example>/src` folder contains the source code and build tools.

## Setup

Relative paths are used in the provided `do_*` scripts and Maven build files. They assume the following installation paths:

- `C:\OpenText\idol_oem_tutorials\resources\apis\aci\java`
- `C:\OpenText\IDOLJavaSDK_25.4.0\`

### Setup - Build

Before you can build any of the example code, you will need to run the provided  `do_mvn_install_jar.*` script once in order to make the IDOL Java SDK jar file(s) available to Maven.

To build and then run each example the constants `USE_IDOL_OEM_ENCRYPTION` and `IDOL_OEM_ENCRYPTION_KEY` will need to be updated with same encryption key information provided in the `OEMstring.txt` file.

### Setup - Run

In the `do_run_*.*` scripts, the hostname, port and other service specific settings may need to be updated for your ACI service instance.

To use the pre-built `/target` classes, the `do_run.*` scripts (`ACI_API_TUTORIAL_PROGRAM_ENCRYPTION_KEY` variable) need to be updated with the encryption key information provided in the `OEMstring.txt` file.  See [here](../../../tutorials/aci_api/introduction.md#obtain-an-oem-license-key) for details on obtaining an OEM-style license key.

### Required third-party tools

- Java JDK 1.17 or higher, *e.g.*
  - [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org)

- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

- A (UTF-8 capable) text editor, *e.g.*:
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), or
  - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

- A Markdown viewer
  - Plugins to VS Code, Notepad++ and some web browsers are good options

## getStatus

This sample code is for use with all IDOL services, since `action=getStatus` is an administrative action supported by all IDOL service types.  It can also serve as the foundation for implementing other actions.

## fetch_synchronize

This sample code is for use with IDOL Connectors issuing the basic settings for `action=fetch` and implementing `fetchAction=synchronize`. It can also serve as the foundation for implementing other fetch actions.

> NOTE: The `do_run.*` script may need to be updated with your configured fetch task name in `TASK_NAME`.

## fetch_identifiers

This sample code is for use with IDOL Connectors issuing the basic settings for `action=fetch` and implementing `fetchAction=identifiers`. It can also serve as the foundation for implementing other fetch actions.

> NOTE: The `do_run.*` script may need to be updated with your configured fetch task name in `TASK_NAME`.

## fetch_collect

This sample code is for use with IDOL Connectors issuing the basic settings for `action=fetch` and implementing `fetchAction=collect`. It can also serve as the foundation for implementing other fetch actions.

> NOTE: The `do_run.*` script will need to be updated with the `IDENTIFIERS_CSV` for the data to collect.

> NOTE: The `do_run.*` script may need to updated with the `DESTINATION_FOLDER`.

## fetch_delete

This sample code is for use with IDOL Connectors issuing the basic settings for `action=fetch` and implementing `fetchAction=delete`. It can also serve as the foundation for implementing other fetch actions.

> NOTE: The `do_run.*` script will need to be updated with the `IDENTIFIERS_CSV` for the data to collect.

## fetch_insert

This sample code is for use with IDOL Connectors issuing the basic settings for `action=fetch` and implementing `fetchAction=insert`. It can also serve as the foundation for implementing other fetch actions.

> NOTE: The `do_run.*` script may need to be updated with your configured fetch task name in `TASK_NAME`.

> NOTE: A `insertXML.xml` will need to be updated containing properly formatted `<insertXML>` syntax for the connector being used.  For more details, refer to the documentation for the connector being used.

> NOTE: The `do_run.*` script may need to be updated with the `INSERT_XML_FILE` path containing the data to insert.

## fetch_update

This sample code is for use with IDOL Connectors issuing the basic settings for `action=fetch` and implementing `fetchAction=update`. It can also serve as the foundation for implementing other fetch actions.

> NOTE: A `identifiersXML.xml` will need to be updated containing properly formatted `<identifiersXML>` syntax for the connector being used.  For more details, refer to the documentation for the connector being used.

> NOTE: The `do_run.*` script may need to be updated with the `IDENTIFIERS_XML_FILE` path containing the data to update.

## queueInfo_getStatus

This sample code is applicable to all IDOL services (*e.g.* Connectors, CFS, MediaServer and Content) that support asynchronous actions.  `action=queueInfo&queueAction=getStatus` is to get the status.

> NOTE: The `do_run.*` may need to be updated with the `QUEUE_NAME` appropriate for the IDOL service type in use.  Asynchronous actions are supported by connectors, CFS, MediaServer and other IDOL service types.

> NOTE: The `do_run.*` script will need to be updated with the token returned by asynchronous actions like `action=fetch` to check the status of a particular token.  If the TOKEN variable is set to empty string then recent tokens status will be returned.

## ms_process

This sample code is for use with IDOL Media Server issuing the basic settings for `action=process`.

> NOTE: The `do_run.*` script will need to be updated with the `CONFIG_NAME` appropriate for the intended Media Server processing.  

> NOTE: The `do_run.*` script will need to be updated with the `SOURCE_FILE_PATH` of the rich media file to process.
